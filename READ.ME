   ```

2. **Access the web interface**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

3. **Upload files**
   - Upload an OMR sheet image (PNG/JPG/JPEG)
   - Upload the corresponding answer key Excel file
   - Optionally enter a set number

4. **Run evaluation**
   - Click "Evaluate OMR" to start the processing

## 📊 System Workflow

### 1. Image Acquisition & Preprocessing
- **Input**: High-resolution OMR sheet scans
- **Processing**: Grayscale conversion, adaptive thresholding, contour enhancement
- **Output**: Preprocessed binary image optimized for bubble detection

### 2. Bubble Detection & Organization
- **Detection**: Contour-based circular/oval shape identification
- **Spatial Normalization**: Handles paper rotation up to 5 degrees
- **Organization**: Groups 400 bubbles into 5 subject columns (20 questions × 4 options each)
- **Sorting**: Vertical arrangement within each subject column

### 3. ML-based Mark Classification
- **Model**: Pre-trained bubble classification model (`bubble_model.pkl`)
- **Analysis**: Pixel density and pattern recognition within each bubble
- **Classification**: Binary classification (filled/unmarked) with 99%+ accuracy
- **Validation**: Real-time visual feedback with color-coded overlays

### 4. Answer Mapping & Validation
- **Mapping**: Converts bubble patterns to A/B/C/D answers
- **Grouping**: Every 4 bubbles represent one question
- **Validation**: Single-answer constraint checking
- **Error Handling**: Manages blank responses and multiple marks

### 5. Score Calculation & Reporting
- **Processing**: Individual subject evaluation (20 questions each)
- **Scoring**: Subject-wise scores (out of 20) and total score (out of 100)
- **Reporting**: Interactive results display with detailed breakdowns

## 📝 Answer Key Format

The Excel answer key should follow this structure:

| Python | EDA | SQL | POWER BI | Satistics |
|--------|-----|-----|----------|-----------|
| A      | B   | C   | D        | A         |

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Training
To retrain the bubble classification model:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

### Custom Subjects
To modify subjects, update the `subjects_order` list in `app.py`:
```python
subjects_order = ['Python', 'EDA', 'SQL', 'POWER BI', 'Satistics']
```

### Question Count
To change questions per subject, modify:
```python
questions_per_subject = 20  # Adjust as needed
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No bubbles detected**
- Check image quality and resolution
- Ensure proper lighting and contrast
- Verify OMR sheet format compatibility

**Incorrect bubble classification**
- Review bubble marking quality
- Check for smudges or incomplete marks
- Consider retraining the model with new data

**Missing subjects in Excel**
- Verify exact subject name spelling
- Check column headers in answer key
- Ensure all required subjects are present

**Score calculation errors**
- Validate answer key format
- Check Excel file structure
- Verify question count matches expected format
